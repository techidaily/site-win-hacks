## Ultimate Tutorial on Changing Vimeo File Types to Popular Formats Such as AVI, FLV, and MP3

### Overview

Just like YouTube, Vimeo is another popular video sharing website and Vimeo supports high-definition video sharing. However, with many young users having less time to watch the online Vimeo video, they prefer to watch the Vimeo video on their Apple products in an offline mode. Is there a method to do that?

Well, according to Vimeo official website, Vimeo Plus, PRO, Business, and Premium members are allowed to enable their uploaded Vimeo videos for download, but in practice, not many Vimeo subscribed users support their video for free download, let alone to an MOV format. So how to do that?

Now the following article just introduces a professional Vimeo to MOV downloader to help users to easily download and convert any Vimeo video to an MOV format.
