## Replacement, Compatible, and Platform Names Like macOS and Windows.

### Overview

* MacTubes can not work to download YouTube videos any more and I have tried two other YouTube downloaders, but one takes longer time to download YouTube videos and the other gives me poor YouTube quality. Can you recommend me a professional MacTubes alternative to help me to download YouTube videos with satisfaction?

YouTube is so popular that many YouTube downloaders have been created to download YouTube videos and MacTubes is one of them. MacTubes is free to use for Mac users, but bad news is that MacTubes stops working since 2015 after YouTube changed its API. The bad news forced MacTubes users to turn to other MacTubes alternatives to help them to download YouTube videos. If you have not found one functional MacTubes alternative you can try Allavsoft which is reported by users as the top 1 MacTubes alternative.
